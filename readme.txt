Main Folder: Detector simulation in CPP 

This folder has the codes developed as a project to 
simulate a HPGe detector at the Course Computational Methods
in Physics in the Master. 

The detector is simulate as 3D matrix with coefficients relate
to the radiation interaction with the specific material of the 
detector: HPGe, air, aluminum, Cu.
